This is a NextJS React website developed using the "Next.js 13 Full Course 2023 | Build and Deploy a Full Stack App Using the Official React Framework" tutorial by JavaScript Mastery.

I've built a project that allows users to share useful prompts that other users can use when using AI tools such as ChatGPT, etc.

This project makes use of Next.js 13, TailwindCSS, MongoDB, and more.

Thanks to JavaScript Mastery for this project (find the links below)

After using Next.js since around version 12, I finally saw this tutorial by JavaScript Mastery that used Next.js version 13 along with the new App router. Aswell as Next.js 13, I finally got to try out TailwindCSS which I have been really eager to try out. This tutorial also made use of MongoDB and demonstrated how to integrate MongoDB with Next.js 13 and the App router.

So, all in all, from this tutorial, I learned alot about how to integrate multiple systems and frameworks (mostly CSS frameworks) with the new Next.js 13 App router and API routes. This tutorial also demonstrated how to use Google's OAuth authentication to allow users to sign in to their Google account's and post their recommended AI prompts found through systems such as ChatGPT, etc.

Overall, this tutorial taught me alot about how to integrate multiple systems and frameworks, such as TailwindCSS, to build a fully functional and full-stack application using Next.js 13's newest features while also getting to learn how to integrate Google's OAuth Authentication and creating profiles for each individual user.
