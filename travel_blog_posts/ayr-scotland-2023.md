summary: 'My family and I decided to go to Ayr to shop a little and chill out near the beach.'

To start I'd just like to say that I sometimes forget how insanely beautiful the Scottish landscape can be. Just baffles me how beautiful the landscape is here.
Anyway... The travel from Glasgow Central to Ayr was really nice and chill. Listening to music and chilling on the train is one of my favourite past times... Just so nice and chill. I do plan on coming back to Ayr again sometime this year, but driving instead of taking the train.

First, we walked down to the seafront (obviously, that's the best part... right?) and looked out over the sea where I was informed that you could actually see all the way to the Isle of Arran... how crazy is that? Obviously took some photos of the seafront, but this was later in the day.

Next, we decided to take a stroll up towards the shopping centre to have a look around what was available for purchase. We actually saw a plane fly over us because Prestwick International Airport is quite close to Ayr - see the video of the plane flying over us below!

As we were going up to Ayr's shopping centre, we stopped into check out some of the stores along the main road (I think?) We went into CeX (mostly a Tech store and as you can probably guess, I'm an absolute Tech nerd). I saw a nice camera in CeX that was around £150, so not bad (I think it was a Canon D3100 or something, is that good?).

Next we went into a cool gift store that sold all things from cool gifts for weddings, graduations, birthdays, and more. It even sold cards for alot of the occasions that you would need a card for! Lastly, we decided to go into Waterstones... because who doesn't love to read books and look at board games... right? Waterstones is amazing!

We then walked up to the shopping centre where we pretty much just chilled out in the nice cool breeze... because it was like 26°C almost all day! That's summer for you in Scotland haha!

After visiting the shopping centre, we started to go back down to the seafront. On the way we looked for a Chippy (that's Scottish for a "Fish and Chip Shop") where I saw a really awesome Nissan GTR! That car looks awesome.

We finally reached the seafront, and I sometimes CAN'T believe how amazing the scenery in Scotland is... Like seriously though, Scotland is amazing!

After having a break at the seafront, we decided it was time for some dinner before heading home. So, we decided to walk back up to the Chippy near the main street (again, I think?) where I got some Chips and Gravy. We then headed back towards the train station to go back home.
